# AI Auto-Apply Implementation Plan

This document outlines how to build an AI-powered "auto-apply" feature that generates custom application materials and submits them automatically.

## 1. User Profile Collection
- Store candidate info: name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, resume (PDF/JSON).
- Optionally collect answers to common screening questions and cover-letter templates.

## 2. Fetch & Parse Job Posting
- Use your job search API or scrape job portal to retrieve:
  - Job title, description, company, apply URL.
- Extract key requirements (skills, experience) via regex or AI summarization.

## 3. Generate Custom Application Materials
- Call OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4) with prompt:
  > "Given this resume (JSON) and job description, write a 250-word cover letter emphasizing my experience with X, Y, Z."
- Store generated cover letter and any optimized resume snippets.

## 4. Automate Submission
1. Choose a headless framework: Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium.
2. For each `applyUrl`:
   ```js
   await page.goto(applyUrl);
   // detect and fill fields
   await page.type('input[name="name"]', user.name);
   await page.type('input[name="email"]', user.email);
   await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', resumePdfPath);
   await page.type('textarea[name="coverLetter"]', generatedCoverLetter);
   await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
   await page.waitForSelector('.confirmation');
   ```
3. Capture success/failure and log details.

## 5. Handling Variations & Edge Cases
- **ATS Differences**: Support common platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday) by writing per-platform selectors.
- **Bot Protection**: Use stealth plugins, proxies, or human-in-loop for CAPTCHAs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle requests to avoid IP blocking; implement retry logic.

## 6. User Controls & Transparency
- Let users select which jobs to auto-apply to.
- Provide a dashboard showing in-progress and completed applications.
- Offer preview of AI-generated materials before submission.

## 7. Legal & Ethical Considerations
- Review terms of service of target sites; obtain consent.
- Disclaim potential risks (CAPTCHA blocks, wrong submissions).
- Ensure data privacy and security for user info.
